      <h4>My lights are not being detected!</h4>
      <p>
        Hue Lynx connects to your lights through your local network.
        Make sure that your computer and your lights are on the same network.
        If only some of your lights are being detected, try detecting lights again until all of your lights are found.

      <h4>My lights are acting weird!</h4>
      <p>
        Before using Hue Lynx, make sure that you do not have any other apps using your lights.

      <h4>Why does music match not work?</h4>
      <p>
        Music match relies on Windows WASAPI drivers to work. Linux and Mac are
        unfortunately currently unsupported, though this may change in the future.

      <h4>Why is music match not matching to my music?</h4>
      <p>
        Even though the algorithm has been adjusted to work for a diverse range
        of music, it is still not perfect. It is quite difficult to make on
        algorithm that works for all music. If you are having trouble, try the
        different presets or experiment by adjusting the different parameters.
