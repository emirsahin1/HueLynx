# Hue Lynx
An un-official desktop app to control Lifx brand lights. 

## Download / Installation
[Download Latest Windows Release - V1.01](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SN4XHH2E4XKy8onRe0EucJeE374uLRg3/view?usp=drive_link)

After downloading, extract the files and run HueLynx.exe. 
Windows may warn about it being from an untrusted source but you can click "more" to proceed. If you don't want to run it as a .exe file, please see below to run it from the source code yourself.

Mac Version is in Progress.


## Features:
* **Screen Mirroring**: The lights can be set to match the average color of your screen. The region of the screen used can be modified using the region selector UI.

* **Music Matching**: In Music Match mode, the lights will trigger at the beat of your music. The frequency and peak detection parameters can be customized to match your specific type of music. Music Matching only works on Windows currently.

* **Manual Control**: If you simply want to change the color of your lights manually, you can do that too!
